# Portfolio Website – Paloma Cardozo

This is my personal portfolio site, created to showcase the projects I’ve built during my Front-End learning journey. It highlights my skills, background, and passion for tech and design. 
This portfolio website presents a selection of projects built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each project includes a short description, a link to the live version, and highlights of what I worked on or learned. 
The portfolio itself is responsive and aims for accessibility and visual clarity.
