# 🌱 Paloma Cardozo – Front-End Developer Portfolio

This is my personal **portfolio website**, designed to present my projects, technical progress, and purpose as a front-end developer passionate about accessibility, responsible tech, and social impact.

This site is more than a portfolio — it's a reflection of my commitment to **tech for good**, optimized code, and inclusive design. It includes interactive elements, dark mode, animated transitions, and ESG-themed microcopy on each project.
